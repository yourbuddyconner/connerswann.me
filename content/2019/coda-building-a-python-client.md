# What's Coda?

Coda is a Crypto Protocol that I am working on as part of the O(1) Labs Team. Coda implements a "succinct" blockchain that effectively "[swaps the traditional blockchain for a tiny cryptographic proof.](https://codaprotocol.com/)" 

Practically, this means that in the average Coda node, once a transition *(a.k.a. block)* with transactions is "swapped" for a proof, it gets thrown out to save disk space. 

# The Problem 

I like to build prototypes, and my language of choice is Python.

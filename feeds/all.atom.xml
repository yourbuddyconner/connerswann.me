It's pretty important that these semi-critical services stay online as much as possible, however in furtherance of this goal I ran into one major issue: the shape of my house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My computer is upstairs and the cable modem is ~200 feet away, through multiple floors, in the basement. I obviously have in-home Wi-Fi, but occasionally the Mac would disconnect from the network with no warning, and the only way to get it back on was to physically be there at the keyboard. Not Optimal! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a gigantic issue because simply sitting down, logging in, and cycling the Wi-Fi power is all that's needed to reconnect. However, this is really inconvenient if I'm not physically there but still want to consume the media on the machine -- so I set out to fix the problem for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, Apple is really good about providing command-line control over hardware functionality in most circumstances, and Wi-Fi is no exception. There is a handy program on all OS X Machines called &lt;code&gt;networksetup&lt;/code&gt;. Here's an excerpt from the man page entry: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;NAME&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nv"&gt;networksetup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;tool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;network&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Preferences&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nv"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;networksetup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;used&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;network&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;typically&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;configured&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Preferences&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;networksetup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nv"&gt;requires&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;least&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;admin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;privileges&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;commands&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;privileges&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;.

     &lt;span class="nv"&gt;Any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;takes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;will&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;accept&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;place&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;indicate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;should&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;stdin&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;code&gt;networksetup&lt;/code&gt; exists and how it works, I set out to whip up a little BASH script that can be run with cron and can check for internet connectivity and cycle the Wi-Fi if necessary. Below is what I came up with: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/yourbuddyconner/22c37e5246b041fd5c6e4d1e89db0d34.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the script was written, it was trivial to add it to my crontab to be executed once every couple minutes. I also set up external monitoring Namecheap's Dynamic DNS service and UptimeRobot.com, but that's a topic for a future post. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>MyCI - A Look Into My Personal Cloud Environment</title><link href="https:///myci-a-look-into-my-personal-cloud-environment.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-04T20:14:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-05-04T20:14:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Conner Swann</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-05-04:/myci-a-look-into-my-personal-cloud-environment.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Why Do I Need a Personal Cloud Environment?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https:///images/2017/Leveraging-the-Cloud-Featured-Image.jpg"&gt;
For a long time now, I have enjoyed doing personal software projects that teach me new skills, frameworks or even programming languages. I think that an engineer in a computer-science-related field should always be learning new technology and innovating. However, at times it can be a real struggle to get anything done quickly. When it comes to complex web-based systems there's so much that goes into learning a new language or framework that the entire process quickly becomes overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common problem that many small companies and startups face, and it's one I have personally run into time and time again in my personal projects. Due to the layered nature of web-based communications, there's potentially a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; involved when setting up a development environment. That overhead can at times discourage me from even starting a cool new project to begin with, and that's no fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My training and experience as a DevOps Engineer however comes in handy in this situation, so I set out to solve this tricky problem for myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Does It Help Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to take the computer scientist's approach whenever possible, and this tricky infrastructure problem is no exception. The Computer Science approach is traditionally "work smarter, not harder," so in that vein my motto for infrastructure is the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you're doing something manually, you're doing something wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Conner Swann&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any good DevOps automation system acts like a 10x multiplier for efficiency to a talented software engineer. It allows them to automate the tedium of their day-to-day and spend more time on software issues, which not only increases developer happiness but the happiness of their managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I designed my personal cloud infrastructure with this in mind. The system reacts to triggers in my software development cycle and kicks off complex jobs and workflows that I would have started manually, almost before I considered doing it myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What Is My Stack?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Docker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Docker. The current trend of containerization in tech has provided an incredibly powerful tool and abstraction that software developers everywhere can leverage to drastically increase efficiency. I use Docker because it allows the Software Engineer in me ignore the underlying hardware and focus entirely on the interaction between my code and the dependencies inside the container. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest gripes when I started coding was the dreaded conflicting dependency on my development machine. It's entirely possible to have one project that requires Python 2.7 and another that requires Python 3. If you don't necessarily know your way around a package manager, or worse you don't have access to one, you might be in for a bad time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker saves you from this by compartmentalizing the application and all its dependencies in a special "box" that is logically separated from all the other "boxes" that share the resources of the host machine. In this way, it saves you a lot of the headache when trying to get two applications you wrote to play nicely together on one host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https:///images/2017/Docker-API-infographic-container-devops-nordic-apis.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Container Orchestration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you figure out how powerful Docker can be, you ask the next logical question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How can I run a bunch of Docker containers at once?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't necessarily have a concrete answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use Google's &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://mesos.apache.org/"&gt;Apache Mesos&lt;/a&gt;, however, if most of your Docker experience is with Docker-Compose in a development environment, learning one or the other can be a blocker to even getting your personal cloud setup! Both Kubernetes and Mesos are amazing, enterprise-grade container orchestration systems in their own right, but unless you have experience using them, it's overkill for your average free-time software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="image-div" style="width: 400px;"&gt;
![]({static}/images/2017/SWARM.png)
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/"&gt;Docker Swarm&lt;/a&gt;, however container management is entirely through the CLI. If you want a web-based UI to make your life easier, you're out of luck because the UI offering from Docker inc. is enterprise-only and &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/pricing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; expensive.  While Docker (the company) isn't helping out hackers wrangle their containers, it's worth mentioning that there are open-source alternatives like &lt;a href="http://portainer.io/"&gt;Portainer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shipyard-project.com/"&gt;Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; which do provide web UIs for Docker Swarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution I eventually decided on is a free and open-source container management and orchestration software named &lt;a href="http://rancher.com/"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;. Rancher checks all my boxes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's Docker-based and natively supports Docker-Compose for stack definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's free and open-source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easy to install and configure. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's backed by a wonderful community and core development team that are very responsive to issues and suggestions on Slack and at meetups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a web-based UI that I can use to visually manage my containers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Rancher lets me so easily launch and manage containers, I can easily run an arbitrary number of web-based services. It's trivial to add more Docker hosts to your environments, meaning I can start small and scale up when I need more resources.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Rancher" src="https:///images/2017/Rancher-Logo-Final-300x180.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continuous Integration and Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the infrastructure is set up and running, it's time to start thinking about how you're going to run your own software on it. I personally am really annoyed by repetitive tasks and strive to streamline my development cycle as much as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used &lt;a href="https://jenkins.io/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; extensively at work, and while he's a real workhorse he's a bit overkill for my purposes. Instead, I use &lt;a href="https://github.com/drone/drone"&gt;Drone&lt;/a&gt; a container-first Continuous Delivery platform built on Docker, and written in Go. It's still a fairly young project, but what's there currently is more than sufficient for my needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drone integrates with Github and Rancher! All I have to do is add a configuration file called &lt;code&gt;.drone.yml&lt;/code&gt; to my root directory and place it with git. It makes my life easy by automatically connecting to my Github account and configuring selected repositories for webhook delivery. When I push code to one of my repos, Drone is automatically notified and a build begins automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A build consists of first, testing the code using application-specific tests in each repository. Then if all that passes, a Docker container with the application is packaged up and uploaded to the Dockerhub image registry. Lastly, once the image has arrived at the registry, Drone makes an API call to Rancher and upgrades an existing service in place with the new image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of success or failure, Drone then sends a Slack message informing me of the outcome and a link to the build UI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Drone CI Screenshot" src="https:///images/2017/drone-ci-screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Putting it Together&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the power of this CI system, I made a quick little example project that I've thrown up on Github. It's a little flask app that returns "Hello World!" when you make a GET request to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hosted here. But here's some of the juicy code so you don't have to go so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;code&gt;.drone.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, which is basically where all the magic happens:
&lt;pre class="line-numbers"&gt;
&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;
pipeline:
  test:
    image: python:2.7
    commands: 
      - pip install -r application/requirements.txt
      - python application/tests.py
  publish:
    image: docker
    commands:
      - docker login -u "$DOCKER_USERNAME" -p "$DOCKER_PASSWORD"
      - docker build -t yourbuddyconner/docker-hello-world .
      - docker push yourbuddyconner/docker-hello-world
    environment:
      - DOCKER_USERNAME=${DOCKER_USERNAME}
      - DOCKER_PASSWORD=${DOCKER_PASSWORD}
    volumes:

    secret_key: ${RANCHER_SECRET}
    service: hello-world/hello-world
    docker_image: yourbuddyconner/docker-hello-world:latest
    confirm: true
    timeout: 120
  slack:
    image: plugins/slack

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup makes it ridiculously easy for me to launch a large number of containers running homebrew software with minimal interference from me. I can push code, go make coffee, and come back knowing that there's a new build of my code online. Well... either that or I messed up somewhere and I'm going to have a lead on how to fix it when I sit down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a virtually limitless set of problems that Splunk easily solves. From the usual IT systems analysis to advanced visualization of business trends and statistics, you'd be hard-pressed to find a decently-sized analytics task that Splunk would preform poorly with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the vast array of &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; Splunk can do, in this and subsequent posts, I'm going to examine two different use-cases for Splunk. This one looks at it from a Business-Analytics perspective and the next one will be from a more traditional IT Intrusion Prevention perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;7/11 - Indonesia&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="7/11 Logo" src="https:///images/2015/7-Eleven-Logo.PNG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pre-Splunk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009 7/11, the US gas station and convenience store chain, decided to expand to Indonesia, a new and foreign market to them. This obviously required them to come up with new promotions, sell new products, and predict when customers were going to want a particular product so they were sure to have it in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be successful in the new region, the company had to compete with pre-existing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warung"&gt;"warungs"&lt;/a&gt; -- small casual cafes and shops that are ubiquitous across the island nation. To do this, 7/11 stores in the country sold local foods along with the usual soft drinks and convenience store items. In addition, stores also provide amenities like outdoor seating, WiFi, and music to customers to make them more hospitable to a younger middle-class clientele. This allowed them to not only establish a foothold in the country, but thrive and expand to 100+ stores nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maintain a healthy revenue stream and stay on top of their competition, 7/11 set up information-gathering infrastructure in order to identify trends in their Point of Sale data. However, this system was designed and built on top of their legacy IT systems and was markedly rigid in its processes. As a result, while they were able to glean insights from their data, the process required actual people to manually analyze data for significant portions of the process. From the moment they decided to process data in a time range, it could take as long as 3 months to organize and execute a marketing campaign. While the data &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; available to them and provided useful insights on what their customers wanted at a particular time, the process was far from real-time analysis and ultimately could be improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-Splunk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the company began searching for another data analysis platform to give them an edge in Indonesia, and after vetting several other competitors in the space, ended up choosing Splunk. By forwarding logs from Point of Sale systems in each location to a central Splunk cluster and taking advantage of the real-time nature of Splunk's data analytics, 7/11 was able to drastically increase the efficiency of its marketing and promotions machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adopting Splunk, the company cut their time-to-promotions by over 80%. Whereas before it took over three months to plan and prepare a marketing campaign, after Splunk it only takes them two week's time from the moment they decide to put together a campaign to the point where the campaign is live. In addition, Splunk allows 7/11 to take other data sources into account when deciding what products to stock at any particular time. By consuming weather forecasts from the &lt;a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/"&gt;Yahoo! Weather API&lt;/a&gt;, they are able to predict when certain products will be in high demand days or weeks in advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I hope you can see, Splunk is immensely useful when collecting data from IT resources to affect business decisions. The next post in this series will examine how I personally used Splunk at work for a proof-of-concept in Information Security. I leveraged Splunk by collecting data from a series of Raspberry Pi SSH HoneyPots and creating Splunk Alerts when potentially malicious activity appears elsewhere in our system. Stay Tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping with the Splunk theme, early this fall I put together a classroom presentation on the Splunk to introduce students at Northern Arizona University to the software and help them understand the sorts of use-cases it is really useful for. Today, I decided to take the general information contained within the presentation and turn it into a handy blog post for those people who might be googling "What the heck is Splunk?!" or something similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part one in a multi-part post. Today I'll discuss the multitude of problems Splunk is targeting and how it uniquely solves them in a way that is capable of affecting how an entire business handles their day-to-day workflow. ~~Stay tuned for~~ &lt;a href="http://connerswann.me/youve-got-junk-in-your-splunk-part-2-an-examination-of-real-world-use-cases-for-splunk/"&gt;Here's the next post&lt;/a&gt; where I'll put the Splunk workflow into context with real-world use cases!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, the majority of "Enterprise Data" is generated by machines preforming a variety of different functions at any given time. Often-times, this data that's generated and saved to log files is not human-readable, and when it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; human-readable there's often too much of it to process manually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data comes from tens, hundreds, or even thousands of different applications, all of whom potentially output their logs in as many different formats as there are applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splunk has a multitude of use-cases, from IT Analytics to planning marketing campaigns. The following are some problems people in varying positions of might use Splunk to solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dan the developer is asked to help figure out why his code is crashing on Sundays at Midnight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sally the SysAdmin has no idea why users from one office location can’t log in to their computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ivan the InfoSec Analyst has no idea a hacker in Bulgaria is sending spam from his servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Billy the Business Analyst needs to figure out what localities are using his company’s applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Molly the Marketing Executive needs to analyze her affiliate marketing campaigns to see if improvements can be made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine Data is the most rapidly growing segment of the arena experts call "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data"&gt;Big Data&lt;/a&gt;." This stuff gets generated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year and will continue to be generated forever. This set of data contains a categorical record of everything a user does online (and oftentimes offline). The main problem is that the value from this data is, for the most part, untapped -- the data sits on a server until it gets deleted to make room for more data that rarely (or never) gets looked at. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Does Machine Data Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about how difficult "Machine Data" is to process manually, it's really important to be able to visualize exactly why it's so difficult to process. Below are some examples text that Splunk might consume: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;HoneyPot Logs:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="language-accesslog"&gt;
&lt;code class="language-accesslog" data-language="Honeypot Log"&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Webserver Logs:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="language-accesslog"&gt;
&lt;code class="language-accesslog" data-language="Apache Access Log"&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre class="line-numbers language-json"&gt;
&lt;code class="language-json" data-language="json"&gt;

        ], 
        "symbols":[], 
        "user_mentions":[], 
        "urls":[]
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Text Messages:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre class="language-accesslog"&gt;
&lt;code class="language-accesslog" data-language="text-message"&gt;

message="I mean, I can, those pancakes were so good"
&lt;/code&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I hope you can see, the data above is incredibly dense and hard to parse by the human eye unless you're trained to know what to look for. Even to the untrained eye though, if you look closely, there's a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of data contained in these short excerpts -- there's timestamps, hashtags, messages, HTTP Methods, IDs and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, it might be possible to connect these discrete events together, timestamp to timestamp, username to username, etc. If only you had a platform that could read and understand these disparate formats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter Splunk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, lucky for you, Splunk does just that! Splunk fills several roles when it comes to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_intelligence"&gt;"Operational Intelligence"&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Universalforwarder"&gt;Splunk Universal Forwarder&lt;/a&gt; collects lines from log files as they are added to end-systems and forwards them to the Splunk Indexer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Indexer"&gt;Splunk Indexer&lt;/a&gt; parses log events sent to it from the Universal Forwarder or by other means, splits them into key-value fields, and stores them for safe-keeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this may not seem  too groundbreaking, however, when you consider that this interaction occurs constantly and that old data gets saved in Splunk's data warehouse, there's a lot of power to be had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Business Reactivity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Business Reactivity Graph" src="https:///images/2015/business-reactivity.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram above describes different stages of "Reactivity" in a business. At the lower left we have, "Search and Investigate." A business at this stage finds out things are broken hours or sometimes days after-the fact. Fixing a problem a business like this might be facing often requires a person to manually read over days of log files to figure out what went wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two intermediate states "Proactive Monitoring and Alerting" and "Operational Visibility" describe a business who has some good practices in place that allow them to be less reactive. Operational Visibility is the ability to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; how each part of your system is communicating with one another, usually in one place, a dashboard for example. (As an aside, Netflix has a really good &lt;a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/01/improving-netflixs-operational.html"&gt;Blog Post&lt;/a&gt; about how they use real-time data analysis to improve their Operational Visibility.) This entails knowing when and what sorts of data is being passed around at any discrete point in time. This is immensely useful when a piece of a distributed system is acting up and someone needs to get down to fixing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper-right state is "Real-Time Business Insights." A business who has processes in place to achieve this is in the best shape of all when it comes to being proactive. It implies that the business has both historical and real-time data to analyze and make up-to-the-minute decisions with. Splunk takes businesses immediately to this stage if well thought-out and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Splunk Helps You to be "Proactive"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By storing historical data, Splunk allows a user to determine baselines in activity and look at how those baselines have changed over time. With a little help from someone who knows the Splunk query language, it can identify what is considered to be "normal" behavior and also anomalous events that might affect business decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Splunk enables the IT Professional to share their complex data with people who might not be as versed in it as they are. This is done through the use of visualizations and graphs which can then be inserted into &lt;a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Dashboard"&gt;Splunk Dashboards&lt;/a&gt; for repeated use. This removed the overhead of having to know what the data looks like, and instead digesting insights in aggregate through pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By implementing a Splunk Cluster on-site, many successful and well-known companies have leveraged the power of Splunk to increase the value of the company as a whole and provide value to pre-existing business decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="http://connerswann.me/youve-got-junk-in-your-splunk-part-2-an-examination-of-real-world-use-cases-for-splunk/"&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be going over some real use-cases for Splunk and case-studies that examine Splunk use in the wild. Stay tuned! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several months ago, I purchased a DJI Phantom 2 Vision from a friend. Since then I've logged about 40 hours flying it, and at this point I can honestly say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made. The Phantom's size and manuverability make it the perfect solution to capture dozens of shots that had previously been rendered impossible without lots of expensive equipment and/or a helicopter rental. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been having loads of fun taking it with me and finding opportunities to get a cool shot. &lt;/p&gt;

Regardless of what's being purchased, from more residence halls and parking (I wish) to contractors, it turns out that pretty much everything is published and freely available due to NAU being a public institution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, one of my friends showed me &lt;a href="http://nau.edu/Contracting-Purchasing-Services/_Forms/Bids/P15JO001/"&gt;a Request for Proposals&lt;/a&gt; that NAU had published, detailing a intent to hire "Federal Lobbying Services and Public Relations Consulting." Now, that got me asking some questions. Why exactly does NAU need federal lobbyists and why is this the first time I was hearing about this? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https:///images/2015/keeping-university-public-lobbying-proposal.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a student, I definitely feel like I am far removed from decisions that often affect me and the general campus community directly. Questions like who is building the new science lab building or how much parking is needed seem to be answered without even consulting the people (students) that the university is (hypothetically) serving. While it is obvious that these proposals are being posted publically, they're posted in areas of the nau.edu website that might be "off the beaten path" for your average student. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can agree that most of these decisions are boring and it makes sense to compartmentalize the decision-making process as much as possible. Furthermore, a lot of these issues are horrendously complex, so sometimes they're understandably difficult to summarize. However, I believe an attempt needs to be made to engage the student body, if only passively so that they know projects are taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was with that sentiment that I decided to throw together a quick proof-of-concept project called &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/KeepNAUPublic"&gt;@KeepNAUPublic&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitter bot that watches the &lt;a href="http://nau.edu/Contracting-Purchasing-Services/NAU-Bid-Board/"&gt;NAU Bid Board&lt;/a&gt; and tweets the title, due date, and a link to the proposal whenever a new RFP is posted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the process is pretty basic, however as time goes on I forsee the ability to search proposals for keywords, red-flags, and other things that a student might care about. I forsee this being a nice visualization of when, where and how NAU makes purchasing decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bot is implemented with a couple Python libraries including &lt;a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt; for HTML scraping and parsing, and &lt;a href="http://www.tweepy.org/"&gt;Tweepy&lt;/a&gt; which I used as a Twitter API Client. I've decided to hold off on posting the source code for now until the bot has been significantly more fleshed out, but if you have any questions about how I went about it, feel free to shoot me a tweet &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/yourbuddyconner"&gt;@YourBuddyConner&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hack AZ: Postgame Report</title><link href="https:///hack-az-postgame-report.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-03-11T06:54:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-03-11T06:54:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Conner Swann</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-03-11:/hack-az-postgame-report.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/../../images/2015/hack-az-cover.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ˈhakəˌTHän/
noun informal
&lt;em&gt;an event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming.
"a series of 48-hour hackathons to build new web and mobile services"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the trends the past couple of years have brought, I have to say that Hackathons are probably the coolest. Together in small groups (~1-6), college and high school-aged students get together and over the course of a sleep-deprived weekend, they create cool hardware or software projects! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https:///images/2015/hack-az-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had found out a couple days before the event that Raytheon Missile Systems was sponsoring a drone challenge, and when I told my team the "Hack Jacks" (consisting of my friends Brandon Paree and Dylan Grayson, along with myself) about it, they were more than interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raytheon had purchased 15 &lt;a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/"&gt;Parrot AR.Drone 2.0&lt;/a&gt;'s, for the purpose of renting them out to teams at Hack AZ so they could write code and hack on them. Each member of the teams with the best hacks would then walk away with their own AR Drone! As luck would have it, we ended up getting to the UA campus early enough to snag one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AR.Drone platform is an amazing beast, it's a quadcopter with a linux box its core. It also has a slick C software development kit, making it relatively easy to get these things to basically fly themselves. It turns out that a nice guy named &lt;a href="https://github.com/felixge/"&gt;felixge&lt;/a&gt; made a cool NodeJS library called &lt;a href="https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone"&gt;Node AR-Drone&lt;/a&gt; which ports many of those C bindings into the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ame2PH67gnk"&gt;only real dev language&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{attach]/images/2015/hack-az-drone-app.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that we wanted to make our drone autonomous, so we leveraged the &lt;a href="http://opencv.org/"&gt;OpenCV&lt;/a&gt; Computer Vision library to do face tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, we built a basic AI that reads frames from the AR Drone's HD camera and searches them for faces. If no suitable objects are immediately visible, the drone enters a search pattern, slowly panning its view until it can see a face. Once it finds a trackable object, the drone changes course and follows it, adjusting its orientation and altitude to keep the face both centered and a constant size in its view (and thus, a constant distance away). It's key to note here that this incorporates basic guidance control elements as well as object identification and collision avoidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was particularly challenging for the three of us, because none of us had any major graphics experience before. We ended up spending the majority of the time reading OpenCV source code and documentation. Unfortunately, with big projects like that it's easy to get lost in their complexity! However, despite the gaps in our knowledge, we picked a project that we felt we could demo well, and that we did. This is a major part of the hackathon, without a good demo, your project is nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time to show off our hack, many of the other teams had trouble getting their drones off the ground, whether it be from quirky code written out of sleep deprevation or other hardware issues. Our presentation in contrast, went off incredibly smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We showcased the facial recognition and search capabilities by first having my teammate Brandon stand in front of the drone to allow it to acquire a lock on his face. He then covered his face with a hand, waited as the drone panned over to the crowd, and much to our delight, it actually acquired a lock and drifted over to look at a spectator! I then had the entire group of people around me cover their faces, and agiain, the drone began to search for another target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all the demos were done, the judges walked off the field to deliberate. After almost an hour, they came back with decisions and we ended up placing third out of more than ten teams!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https:///images/2015/hack-az-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also meant we'd be going home with our very own Parrot AR Drones! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the weekend, I feel like I learned more than I really expected to. I met a bunch of really cool, like-minded people, and being in that sort of environment is both very enriching and a lot of fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The guys at Raytheon (Jonathan, Don, Dennis and more!) were a huge help to us, they went out to the field to help us test our program every time, giving us hours of their time. At the end of the weekend, the probably came out just as tired as we were!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hack AZ organizers deserve a round of applause, we really appreciated the fact that the event had the entire Schence and Engineering Library at UA to itself for the majority of the weekend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ellen, thanks for hanging out with us and taking all those cool pictures!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to check out our code, &lt;a href="https://github.com/yourbuddyconner/drone-hackaz/tree/master/Hack-AZ"&gt;the entire project is on Github&lt;/a&gt;. We've also begun to change and refactor our original gross hackathon code, and it's begun to take shape &lt;a href="https://github.com/yourbuddyconner/drone-hackaz/tree/master/v1.0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-Hackathon, the project consists of an in-browser command-and-control center for the Parrot AR Drone, complete with gamepad support and first-person, bottom camera view, basic telemetry and a battery indicator. There are plenty of features on the roadmap, including more autonomous functionality and FPV goggle support. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been using &lt;a href="http://www.splunk.com/"&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt; a lot at work. According to their website: &lt;/p&gt;

I've been using &lt;a href="http://www.splunk.com/"&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt; a lot at work. According to their website: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see servers and devices, apps and logs, traffic and clouds. We see data—everywhere. Splunk® offers the leading platform for Operational Intelligence. It enables the curious to look closely at what others ignore—machine data—and find what others never see: insights that can help make your company more productive, profitable, competitive and secure. What can Splunk do for you? Just ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team uses the software to index and search through wide-ranging, potentially disparate datasources like server logs, google logins, data from our honeypot, and more. It fills so many use-cases, from tracking down users who have had their passwords phished to allowing us to pinpoint machines which are being tampered with (thanks to the wonder that is &lt;a href="http://www.ossec.net/"&gt;OSSEC&lt;/a&gt;). It's got a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, administering a distributed Splunk environment is actually pretty fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I've been using Splunk so much, I wanted to give it a spin on a personal project. I had read at some point that iOS's text messages are stored in a SQLite database, so I decided to try and pull that data out and do some analysis on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQLite has the advantage of being a flat file, making it perfectly suited for applications where network access either isn't needed or isn't readily available. Luckily for me, the &lt;a href="https://apps.splunk.com/app/958/"&gt;Splunk DB Connect&lt;/a&gt; app can natively parse SQLite and index the data as key-value pairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the iOS text messaging database has been pretty heavily documented in the past, and by using the information &lt;a href="https://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Messages#Indexes"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; I was able to extract the text message database from a backup of my iPhone. There were a lot of entries in this 37MB database, the messages table has over 50,000 entries, each one representing either an outgoing or incoming text message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database also has a 'Handles' table, which stores information about the phone number the user is communicating with. Without joining the two tables, the data is incomplete, so I  crafted a SQL query to grab the data I wanted to index from the table. This query is fed to the Splunk DB Connect app which then takes care of parsing out all 53,024 rows and splitting them up into indivudual events.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="line-numbers"&gt;
&lt;code class="language-sql"&gt;
SELECT message.ROWID as message_id,
    datetime(message.date,'unixepoch', '+31 years', '-6 hours') as timestamp, 
    datetime(message.date_read, 'unixepoch', '+31 years', '-6 hours') as date_read, 
    message.is_from_me as is_from_me,
    message.is_read as is_read,
    handle.id as handle, 
    message.service as service, 
    message.text as message FROM message, 
    handle 
WHERE message.handle_id = handle.ROWID;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The SQL Query to create complete events&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Splunk has digested the data, heading to the Search &amp;amp; Reporting app and typing &lt;code&gt;index=text_messages&lt;/code&gt; into the search box gives me a nice frequency graph and a list of events: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Splunk Screenshot" src="https:///images/2015/personal-analytics-screenshot-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each text message event is just a line of text that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;message_id=53091 timestamp="2015-02-03 20:31:38" date_read="2015-02-03 20:31:28" is_from_me=1 is_read=1 handle=+xxxxxxxxxx service=iMessage message="I know, haha"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Splunk's powerful search tools and some apps created by the Splunk community, I could begin doing some batch processing of all the events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have so much text, the first thing I did was download a &lt;a href="https://apps.splunk.com/app/1179/"&gt;Sentiment Analysis&lt;/a&gt; app. Doing so adds a couple dashboards and the "sentiment" search command which will evaluate one field in every event you give it, assigning the event a positive or negative value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with this new field, I can now create some inferential data about the contents of the database as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I can chart average sentiment over time. To do this, you chain together multiple splunk search commands until the desired output is reached:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;index=text_messages  is_from_me=1 | sentiment twitter message | timechart avg(sentiment) as sentiment span=1mon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In english, it says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In index &lt;code&gt;text_messages&lt;/code&gt;, search for events which have &lt;code&gt;is_from_me&lt;/code&gt; equal to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, run a sentiment analysis on the results' &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; field. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then use the results to chart the average of the &lt;code&gt;sentiment&lt;/code&gt; field over time spans of one month."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting graph looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sentiment over time" src="https:///images/2015/personal-analytics-screenshot-2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By chaining together more complex series of commands, you can get some pretty cool results! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next graph is created by finding the average sentiment and forming a baseline sentiment value, allowing good and bad sentiment to cancel each other out, leaving only a remainder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the blue sentiment portion of the graph, zero is this baseline. Any column that falls below this has a "below average" sentiment while columns that are greater than zero posess an "above average" sentiment as compared with the rest of the events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second yellow line simply charts the number of events in each period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;index=text_messages  is_from_me=1 | sentiment twitter message |eval diff=sentiment-0.788400| eval count=count|  timechart avg(diff) as sentiment, count span=14d&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Splunk Screenshot" src="https:///images/2015/personal-analytics-screenshot-3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last one is my favorite. It overlays the sentiment of incoming messages over the sentiment of outgoing messages. This was to test the hypothesis that the sentiment of incoming texts could affect the sentiment of outgouing texts. While correlation doesn't imply causation, I still think it's interesting that the graphs follow each other in so many places! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;index=text_messages  is_from_me=0 |  sentiment twitter message |  eval diff=sentiment-0.788400 | timechart avg(diff) as sentiment_from span=1mon | appendcols [search index=text_messages  is_from_me=1 |  sentiment twitter message |  eval diff2=sentiment-0.788400 | timechart avg(diff2) as sentiment_me span=1mon]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Splunk Screenshot" src="https:///images/2015/personal-analytics-screenshot-4.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's truly fascinating how each of these events are pretty useless by themselves, however when you take them all into account some interesting information can be gleaned. I plan to continue on with this little Personal Analytics project by incorporating more data sources like sleep analysis, stay tuned! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in this sort of thing, shoot me a tweet &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/yourbuddyconner"&gt;@YourBuddyConner&lt;/a&gt;, I'd love to hear what you think!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Ionic: Dealing with Remote Events on iOS</title><link href="https:///ionic-dealing-with-remote-events-on-ios.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-23T18:03:00-08:00</published><updated>2015-01-23T18:03:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Conner Swann</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-01-23:/ionic-dealing-with-remote-events-on-ios.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past couple semesters, I've been working on an &lt;a href="http://ionicframework.com/"&gt;Ionic&lt;/a&gt; app for my university's radio station.

Ionic is a "hybrid" framework, that is, the main body of the app is written using web technology (AngularJS, HTML, CSS) and that is coupled with Cordova, a piece of softeware that provides an interface between the web view and the bare metal of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, the app needed to be able to play the station's audio stream. Since I've been focusing primarily on the iOS portion of the universal app, a while back I decided it would be really cool if I were able to control the audio from the lockscreen. However, while the documentation for the Objective C side of it is pretty abundant, there's little to none discussing connecting this with Cordova. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lockscreen Controls" src="https:///images/2015/ionic-ios-screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not knowing exactly where to begin, I found and installed this Cordova plugin from Shi11 called &lt;a href="https://github.com/shi11/RemoteControls"&gt;RemoteControls&lt;/a&gt;. It provides a couple ObjC methods that allow you to update the track meta and respond to any remote events that your app might recieve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, on the Objective C side Apple is very particular about &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/EventHandling/Conceptual/EventHandlingiPhoneOS/Remote-ControlEvents/Remote-ControlEvents.html"&gt;which views can and cannot recieve remote events&lt;/a&gt;. The procedure is simple, but in practice with Cordova it gets tricky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be the first responder.&lt;/strong&gt; The view or view controller that presents the multimedia content must be the first responder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn on the delivery of remote control events.&lt;/strong&gt; Your app must explicitly request to begin receiving remote control events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Begin playing audio.&lt;/strong&gt; Your app must be the “Now Playing” app. Restated, even if your app is the first responder and you have turned on event delivery, your app does not receive remote control events until it begins playing audio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last bullet is where the trouble started for me. To handle the streaming audio, I'm currently using &lt;a href="https://github.com/keosuofficial/cordova-audio-stream-plugin"&gt;Cordova Audio Stream&lt;/a&gt;. It leverages the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AVFoundation/Reference/AVPlayer_Class/index.html"&gt;AvPlayer&lt;/a&gt; class to play the audio separately from the webview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, herein lies the problem. If you follow the documentation for RemoteControls, you will subscribe for remote events within your MainViewController.m, the controller for the WebView. However, since the audio is being instantiated and played from a totally different file within the plugins directory (CDVStream.m) the remote events never get sent to the app. I believe this is because the file that requests the remote events must also be the file that instantiates and plays the audio object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO! If you're following, you can probably guess the solution to this problem. Instead of modifying the MainViewController.m I added the remote events subscription to CDVStream.m where the audio was being played from and voila! It works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a primarily web background, this totally wasn't intuitive for me at all, so hopefully this helps someone in the long run! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my version of my CDVStream.m, the same logic can easily be duplicated in any file that plays audio more than likely: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://connerswann.me/playing-with-the-adafruit-cc3000-wifi-shield/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I discussed the Adafruit CC3000 WiFi shield and how I got the hardware and libraries installed. In this post I'm going to show you how I got my WiFi Arduino talking to a simple PHP script. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I think it's helpful to visualize exactly what's going on in these sorts of interactions. The handy diagram below is a rough sketch of what's talking to what (it's actually much more complicated, but the code I wrote pertains to these actors):
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Arduino WiFi Diagram" src="https:///images/2015/internet-of-things-arduino-diagram.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arduino first connects to the WiFi access point through the CC3000, piping the credentials and configuration options through one of several pins on the Arduino to the CC3000 hardware. The CC3000 handles the logistics of sending and revieving messages from the router, returning the results to the Arduino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, through the magic of TCP, these messages that are sent from the Arduino are recieved and interpreted by my server running PHP. For this exercise, I used the &lt;a href="http://www.slimframework.com/"&gt;Slim PHP Framework&lt;/a&gt; to create two URL Routes (more on that later) that the arduino can send requests to -- one that allows it to set a value and one that simply responds with the current value. These values are collected and stored in a MySQL database that is queried by PHP.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the initial request is interpreted by the PHP script, a response is generated and sent back via TCP to the Arduino for it to interpret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I hope you can see, this sort of interaction is highly extensible and can be leveraged to preform all sorts of duties. For example, you could report values to a server and have the server catch them and store them in a database or periodically check for messages and display any that it recieves. Also, with a WiFi shield the communication is totally wireless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Arduino Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's time for the code, however it does require a little explanation. I used an command line application called &lt;a href="https://www.biicode.com/"&gt;"bii"&lt;/a&gt; to do this project. It's a dependancy manager that keeps all your libraries in one place and fetches them from the internet if they're not there locally.  At compile time, bii reads your main C++ file, collects all of the includes, and links them. It's very handy at the expense of having random includes in your file. It is also capable of compiling your Arduino source files and uploading them to your board, a definite plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this because doing advanced interactions via HTTP on the Arduino is actually really hard and requires a lot of string manipulation. HTTP responses in this context are all plain text streams and the CC3000 library doesn't have any capability to parse out any information in the responses it recieves. The Bii repository had a &lt;a href="https://www.biicode.com/lasote/lasote/arduino_http/master/25/readme.md"&gt;nice library created by a guy named "Lasote"&lt;/a&gt; that did just that, so I decided to roll with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example HTTP Response so you have an idea of what you need to parse through and why this client interface is necessary: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class="language-http"&gt;
Date: Thu, 01 Jan 2015 21:27:23 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.5
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 87
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: text/html
{"id":"4","value":"99","reason":"To test if the arduino can decode json"}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to print out &lt;code&gt;ret_code&lt;/code&gt; and the raw response body in &lt;code&gt;response_buffer&lt;/code&gt; (both variables populated by this interface) as opposed to having to parse through the entire string above is pretty handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, without further ado, here's my C++ code for the arduino:
&lt;pre class="line-numbers"&gt;
&lt;code class="language-c"&gt;
// Arduino symbols and Bindings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;include "Arduino.h"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;include "ntruchsess/arduino_uip/uipethernet.h"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// client interface for HTTP communication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;include "lasote/arduino_http/http_client.h"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// a processor to decode JSON&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;include "lasote/stream_processor/stream_json_processor.h"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;include "lasote/stream_recorder/stream_recorder.h"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//For cc3000 adapter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;include &lt;adafruit/cc3000_library/adafruit_cc3000.h&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;include "diego/ardunet/cc3000client.h"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;include "diego/ardunet/cc3000utils.h"&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;define WLAN_SSID       "Atlantis"        // cannot be longer than 32 characters!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//#define WLAN_PASS       "xxxxxxxx"
char WLAN_PASS[] = {0x69, 0x69, 0x69, 0x69, 0x69, 0x00}; 
// Security can be WLAN_SEC_UNSEC, WLAN_SEC_WEP, WLAN_SEC_WPA or WLAN_SEC_WPA2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;define WLAN_SECURITY   WLAN_SEC_WEP&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// These are the interrupt and control pins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;define ADAFRUIT_CC3000_IRQ   3  // MUST be an interrupt pin!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// These can be any two pins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;define ADAFRUIT_CC3000_VBAT  5&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;define ADAFRUIT_CC3000_CS    10&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using namespace lasote;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//create CC3000 instance, and an SDK compatible Client
Adafruit_CC3000 cc3000 = Adafruit_CC3000(ADAFRUIT_CC3000_CS,
        ADAFRUIT_CC3000_IRQ, ADAFRUIT_CC3000_VBAT, SPI_CLOCK_DIVIDER);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CC3000Client client(cc3000);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;char response_buffer[150];
// This processor simply writes the response to a buffer
StreamRecorderProcessor response_recorder(response_buffer, 150); 
HttpClient http_client(client, Serial);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// the keys of the values I'd like to fetch from the response
//const char* queries[] = {"id", "value", "reason"};
//                  processor(ArrayofQueries, nQueries, MaxNameSize, MaxValueSize, MaxTraceSize)
//StreamJsonProcessor processor(queries, 3, 10, 10, 10);

}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On first run, this program runs a subroutine that initializes critical objects and connects to the configures WiFi access point (in this example, it's called Atlantis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then enters a loop, making a request to the server once every ten seconds. I simply have the arduino report this response over Serial, however you can do much more with it. For example, the response can be programmatically used as a trigger to preform advanced functions like turning LED's on/off, sending a text message, or even sending a new HTTP request to a different server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The PHP Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I already discussed above, the PHP is designed to recieve, interpret, and respond to the Arduino's HTTP requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this exercise, I decided to work with &lt;a href="http://www.slimframework.com/"&gt;Slim PHP Framework&lt;/a&gt; because it makes doing this sort of thing trivial, whereas with raw PHP it would be much more involved (read: more code). In this context I'm only utilizing Slim's easy-to-use URL router, however there's plenty more to be had including a templating system and a debugging interface (this last one is immensely useful). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the code: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="line-numbers"&gt;
&lt;code class="language-php"&gt;
&lt; ?php

require 'libs/Slim/Slim.php';
require_once 'dbHandler.php';

\Slim\Slim::registerAutoloader();

$app = new \Slim\Slim();

// create a route at wifitest.php/getvalue
// when someone makes an HTTP GET request here, this function will be called
$app-&gt;get('/getvalue', function() {
    // dbHandler is a piece of code I picked up along the way that encapsulates
    // often repeated SQL commands. I've modified it pretty heavily, and it's probably
    // its own post at this point.
    $db = new DbHandler();
    // grab the record with the highest ID
    $record = $db-&gt;getOneRecord("SELECT * FROM wifitest ORDER BY reading_id DESC");
    // create a new response object and populate it
    $response["id"] = $record["reading_id"];
    $response["value"] = $record["reading_value"];
    $response["reason"] = "To test if the arduino can decode json"; 
    // convert it to JSON and send it back to the client
    echo json_encode($response);
}); 

// create a route at wifitest.php/setvalue
$app-&gt;get('/setvalue', function() use ($app){
    // grab the request parameter from the Slim app object
    $value = $app-&gt;request()-&gt;params('value');
    $db = new DbHandler();
    if ($value){
        // create a new data object
        $newvalue["reading_value"] = $value;
        // insert that ish to the DB 
        $result = $db-&gt;insertIntoTable($newvalue, array('reading_value'), 'wifitest');
        if ($result != NULL) {
            // let the client know the insert was a success
            $response["message"] = "Value saved!";
            $response["code"] = 1;
            echo json_encode($response);
        }
        else{
            // let the user know the insert failed
            $response["message"] = "Value not saved.";
            $response["code"] = 0;
            echo json_encode($response);
        }
    }
});

$app-&gt;run();
?&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

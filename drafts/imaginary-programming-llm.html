                <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a new and powerful tool for engineers that add truly limitless value to their workflow. LLMs like GPT3 and Codex speed up my workflow immensely, and enable me to force-multiply myself -- I am a true LLM maxi. That said, it's easy to discount LLMs as a novelty due to the lack of understanding of their properties. Many engineers struggle to grasp the full potential of LLMs, and some may even find them intimidating.</p>
<p>LLMs have already demonstrated their ability to perform an impressive array of tasks, such as writing poetry, authoring code, and inventing novel combinations of insults and swear words. However, the challenge for programmers is understanding how they can harness this power in a <em>practical</em> way. It's unclear to the average engineer what the properties of LLMs are, and how they can be used effectively. As a result, it's easy to dismiss them as just another trendy fad without taking advantage of their full potential.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore how LLMs can be used effectively in programming by introducing a new approach called "imaginary programming." We will explain the benefits and limitations of LLMs, and provide examples of how imagine your way into a working prototype. By the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of how LLMs can be harnessed to create innovative and powerful products <em>quickly</em>.</p>
<h1>Problems with Prompts</h1>
<p>One of the main challenges that programmers face when working with LLMs is creating effective prompts. Prompts can be analogized as the instructions given to the model that specify the task to be performed. However, outputs don't necessarily get better with more words, what matters most is how you write them. </p>
<p>In addition, humans tend to describe desired outcomes rather than the algorithmic processes required to achieve them. This is at odds with a Transformer model's training and means that programmers may struggle to create prompts that effectively communicate the task at hand to the model in a way it understands. It's not enough to simply describe the desired outcome (for now); the prompt must also include the necessary context and information that biases the model's output towards the desired result. Performance of LLMs can vary widely based on the quality of the prompt -- poor prompt design can result in inaccurate or nonsensical output, making it difficult to rely on the model for important tasks.</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, programmers must learn to craft prompts that succinctly communicate the necessary information to the model. This requires an understanding of the underlying algorithmic processes that the model uses to generate text and a creative approach to designing prompts that can elicit accurate and useful output.</p>
<h1>Simplicity Begets Complexity</h1>
<p>LLMs such as GPT-3 are trained on simple tasks, which means that they can perform well when given clear and simple. As we mentioned previously, asking them to perform complex tasks results in inconsistend and undesired behavior. Instead, programmers must break down complex tasks into simpler units and then chain them together to achieve the desired outcome.</p>
<p>A common task in LLM land is to use the latent knowledge of the model to make up text that fits a particular use-case. More often than not, we'd like to have this text returned to us in a structured format that is compatible with the programming language we're using to wire the prompts together. </p>
<p>However, as we mentioned previously, expecting the model to both <em>be creative</em> and produce <em>structured output</em> is at odds with its training. To help programmers think about prompts in this way, we can use the terms "generator" and "extractor" to describe simple atomic units of this larger task. </p>
<h2>Generators</h2>
<p>A generator creates unstructured information, such as writing a story. Increasing input <em>temperature</em> allows the model to produce less-probable output, which to humans is roughly analagous to <em>creativity</em>. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Generate a conversation between a software engineer with an anxiety about artificial general intelligence and a therapist.
The therapist is secretly an AGI and is trying to downplay the engineer&#39;s concerns.
The software engineer begins to suspect the therapist is a robot.
Ensure your output is no more than 250 words.

<p>By thinking about prompts in this way, we can avoid parsing errors that are inherent in the generation step and build a model that allows one to simplify complex goals into simpler tasks that the LLM can more easily understand and accomplish. This opens is us up to then chain together these simpler units to achieve this more complex behavior -- sounds like programming, huh?</p>
<p>To facilitate this process, there are several prompt chaining libraries available, such as Langchain and LLamaIndex, which allow us to easily chain together different prompts and get this complex behavior we're searching for. However, it's important to remember that even with these tools, creating effective prompts can still be a challenge. It requires creativity, knowledge of the underlying algorithmic processes, and a deep understanding of the task at hand.</p>
<h1>Problematic Python</h1>
<p>While Python is a popular language for machine learning and AI development, it can be problematic when working with LLMs. One of the main issues is that Python doesn't, by default, protect developers from making mistakes pre-runtime, which can lead to bugs and errors that can be difficult to track down. If you don't take extreme care at the outset, as code complexity grows the time-to-debug also grows linearly. </p>
<p>Given the previously-stated issues with prompt engineering as it stands currently, LLM system builders run into the same kinds of problems normal engineers do. You end up with <code>print</code> statements all over and have to keep the entire application's model in your head to infer where problems with the data model might be occuring. </p>
<p>Though Python 3 has a type system available, I personally find it cumbersome. Some might find this acceptable, but considering a situation where one is building a new system from scratch quickly, careful selection of your underlying programming language that biases towards development ease and velocity is incredibly prudent. </p>
<h1>Typescript is "The Way"</h1>
<p>Typescript is becoming an increasingly popular choice for machine learning and AI development due to its strong type system and ability to catch errors at compile-time. This can be especially useful when working with LLMs, as it can help to catch errors in the wiring between prompts and ensure that the input and output from those prompts are properly formatted.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of working with LLMs in Typescript, however, is the difficulty of strongly typing prompt parameters and returns without a cohesive interface. This is where libraries such as Promptable.js come in. Promptable provides a set of abstractions for working with complex prompts that take multiple keyword arguments, making it easier to manage changes to prompts and chain together different atomic units of a larger task. Promptable's templates are a <em>huge</em> step in the right direction, adding string keyword arguments to the prompts which allow them to be dynamically formatted at runtime and drastically improves an individual prompts modularity and usefulness. </p>
<p>Here's how one might implement the aforementioned prompt-primitives in Promptable: </p>
<h2>Generator</h2>
<p>By making some slight modifications to our original prompt, we now can tune the length of the generation programmatically -- this is great! Now users have the ability to take user input and produce text that fits a wider variety of situations with a single prompt. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">generatorPromptTpl</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Prompt</span><span class="p">(</span>

<h2>Extractor</h2>
<p>As with the Generator, putting the Extractor prompt into the Promptable format allows for a more generally flexible LLM prompt which can take arbitrary content and a return type at runtime. </p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>We'll omit the output this time around, considering the prompts are functionally identical, but I hope it's clear to the reader that this is a drastically improves usability and composability of prompts. <em>Super Neat!!</em></p>
<p>It's worth noting, that though this is a <em>huge</em> improvement, we're not fully leveraging the type system here. Given the early state of the library, what it currently lacks is a feature that utilizes strong input and output types. That said, we should cut Promptable.js some slack, it's only been out for a month and the team is tirelessly adding new features daily!</p>
<p>Despite this slight limitation, by using Typescript and libraries like Promptable, developers can more easily manage the complexity of LLMs and create more robust and error-free applications.</p>
<h1>Imaginary Programming</h1>
<p>As is becoming the norm in my LLM-app builder journey, as soon as I begin pontificating on a cool idea, someone inevitably releases a project that executes on it. </p>
<p>Enter: Imaginary Programming -- a name for the concept I have been thinking about all this time!</p>
<p>Imaginary programming is an approach to prompt development that leverages the power of LLMs and the simplicity of natural language to create functional prompts. With imaginary programming, developers can simply describe the task they want to perform in natural language, and the LLM takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>Literally last week, Sasha Aikin released his Imaginary typescript transformer preview which implements a much more functional approach to prompt engineering and synthesis.</p>
<p>The Imaginary.dev transformer library is implemented as a Typescript compiler plugin, which allows developers to write a function signature and a doc string which describes the desired functionality. The plugin, when combined with the Imaginary runtime library, leverages the native compilation step in Typescript to take care of writing the OpenAI generation boilerplate, parsing, and type-checking of inputs and outputs. This makes it <em>incredibly</em> easy to create prompts that can be composed together functionally and reduce the likelihood of runtime errors in glue-code.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of imaginary programming is that it allows developers to quickly build out the business logic for their products, and worry less about the weird edge cases of prompt engineering as it currently stands. <strong>However</strong>, it's important to remember that the quality of the output is still dependent on the quality of the prompt. Developers must still exercise creativity and a deep understanding of the task at hand to create effective prompts.</p>
<p>With imaginary programming and libraries like Imaginary, developers can more easily harness the power of LLMs and create innovative and powerful applications with minimal effort.</p>
<h1>Try it for yourself!</h1>
<p>To illustrate how the Imaginary plugin works, let's re-write the previous prompts again:</p>

<p>Now that the prompt, OpenAI code, input types, and output parsing are all abstracted away by the compile-time transformation, it's <em>much easier</em> to reason about the code in a functional way. The glue code ends up being much simpler, and not to mention type-safe and documented. </p>

<p>With imaginary programming, we can quickly and easily build out complex applications without worrying about the underlying algorithmic processes. By simply describing the desired outcome in natural language, the LLM can take care of the rest.</p>
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>Large Language Models like GPT-3 are powerful tools for natural language processing and have the potential to revolutionize the way we approach programming. However, the complexity of working with LLMs can be daunting, especially for developers who are new to the field.</p>
<p>Imaginary programming provides a new approach to working with LLMs, allowing developers to describe the desired outcome in natural language and letting the LLM take care of the rest. This approach can simplify the programming process and reduce the likelihood of errors.</p>
<p>To effectively use imaginary programming, developers must exercise creativity and a deep understanding of the task at hand to create effective prompts. However, with the right tools and approach, developers can harness the power of LLMs to create innovative and powerful applications with minimal effort.</p>

                <h2>Web3 is Better</h2>
<p>Web3 represents a new frontier for financial services, offering a better monetary system that is faster, more efficient, and more accessible to everyone. Unlike traditional finance (TradFi), which relies on legacy systems and intermediaries to facilitate transactions, Web3 provides a decentralized and trustless infrastructure that can support a range of innovative financial products and services.</p>
<p>In many ways, Web3's rails are simply better than those of TradFi. Transactions can be processed in real-time, without the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors, and settlement is easy and frictionless. This means that users can move their money around quickly and efficiently, with minimal costs and delays.</p>
<p>This is the way it should be. Instead of relying on outdated and inefficient financial systems, we can leverage the power of blockchain technology to build a more inclusive and equitable financial system that serves the needs of everyone, not just a select few. The potential for Web3 is immense, and we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible.</p>
<h2>Web3 Has a Dark Side</h2>
<p>Despite its many benefits, Web3 also has a darker side. The speed and ease with which transactions can be processed in the crypto ecosystem can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, this efficiency can lead to greater liquidity and faster innovation, but on the other hand, it also creates an environment that is ripe for scams and fraudulent schemes.</p>
<p>The history of the crypto industry is littered with examples of grifts and scams, from the infamous Mt. Gox hack to more recent incidents involving The DAO Hack, Bitconnect, Three Arrows, and FTX, Three Arrows, Bitconnect. The fact that these incidents continue to occur despite the industry's best efforts to address them speaks to a deeper misalignment of incentives within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In particular, the speed at which protocols can gain traction and attract TVL can be astronomical, even if they lack true "Product Market Fit." This makes it difficult for the average investor to differentiate between a legitimate crypto-financial instrument and a Ponzi scheme or rug pull. As a result, individuals and protocols alike lack the proper risk mitigation strategies that have existed in corporate policy for the past 1000 years, leaving them vulnerable to unforeseen risks and market fluctuations.</p>
<p>In order to address these challenges, we need to take a more proactive approach to risk management in the crypto ecosystem, leveraging the best practices and frameworks from traditional finance to create a more sustainable and secure financial system for everyone.</p>
<h2>Crypto Lacks the Language of Risk (up only)</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges facing the crypto industry is the lack of a common language of risk. Many participants in the space are drawn to the allure of high returns and the idea that they can "make it" in this new financial ecosystem. This culture of "hopium" is fueled by the tantalizing prospect of wealth creation and the lack of friction in the rails, which make it possible for individuals to participate in the financial system with relative ease.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this excitement can also blind investors and participants to the very real risks that exist in the crypto ecosystem. Risk is often viewed as a niche area of expertise, something that only a select few really understand. This lack of understanding can make it difficult for individuals to evaluate the risks associated with various investment opportunities in the space.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, consider the heuristic we might use to evaluate how risky it is to cross the street. If we see that there are no cars, we might feel comfortable crossing the street, even if the light is red. However, evaluating the risks associated with investing in a new smart contract is much more complicated. Many investors might rely on social media and other non-expert sources for guidance, looking for rocketship emojis or other indicators of success, even if the underlying smart contract is unaudited and unverified.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we need to develop a common language of risk that can be used by all participants in the crypto ecosystem. This language should be grounded in best practices and frameworks from traditional finance, but also take into account the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the crypto industry. By doing so, we can create a more informed and educated community of investors and participants who are better equipped to evaluate risk and make informed investment decisions.</p>
<h2>We need to do better (for the Users)</h2>
<p>As crypto continues to grow and expand, it's important that we as an ecosystem do better to protect our users. The current degenerate risk analysis framework that many crypto enthusiasts employ is not sufficient to mitigate the risks inherent in this new financial paradigm. The Rekt leaderboard is a prime example of this, as it highlights the numerous instances of users being "rekt" due to smart contract bugs, market instability, and other unforeseen events. It's crucial that we realize that these risks are not exclusive to any one individual or protocol, but rather are a shared burden that we all must bear.</p>
<p>While it may be tempting to brush off these risks as statistical outliers, it's important to remember that statistics can and do catch up to everyone eventually. By adopting a more cautious and strategic approach to risk management, we can better protect our users and ensure the long-term viability of the crypto ecosystem as a whole. We owe it to our users to do better, and to build a framework that allows them to fully participate in this new financial paradigm while minimizing their exposure to risk.</p>
<h2>Market Risk isn't the only Risk</h2>
<p>Market risk is often the most prominent risk in the crypto ecosystem, with the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets being one of the key draws for traders and investors. However, there are other risks that are just as important to consider, if not more so. Operational risk, for example, encompasses a range of risks that can arise from a protocol's day-to-day operations, such as technical failures, human error, or fraud. Legal and regulatory risks can also be significant, particularly given the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape for crypto. Additionally, there is reputational risk to consider, as negative headlines or bad press can quickly erode trust and confidence in a protocol.</p>
<p>To address these risks, the crypto ecosystem has developed a range of risk mitigation strategies, such as code audits and kill-switches. However, given the complexity of the crypto ecosystem, risk management is not always straightforward. In many cases, the risks faced by protocols are unique and require innovative solutions. As such, it's important for protocol builders and users alike to remain vigilant and adaptable in their approach to risk management. While it may be impossible to completely eliminate risk, it's possible to mitigate it through careful planning, smart risk management, and a willingness to learn from past mistakes.</p>
<h2>Reinventing the Wheel: A Risk Analysis Framework</h2>
<p>The Web3 ecosystem is in dire need of a common language of risk, best practices for risk management, and a framework for evaluating the risks and rewards of different financial activities. The absence of corporate risk management practices in the crypto space means that individuals and protocols are left to "reinvent the wheel" when it comes to risk analysis and mitigation.</p>
<p>Before launching a crypto-financial product, risk analysis must be the literal first step. Just because you've come up with a novel mechanism and written some Solidity code to implement it doesn't mean it's ready for prime time. You need to sit and think long and hard about the risks involved from the user's perspective.</p>
<p>Developing a more sophisticated approach to risk analysis and mitigation is critical to building a resilient Web3 ecosystem that can handle the risks associated with this new technology. By adopting a common language of risk, best practices for risk management, and a framework for evaluating risks and rewards, we can better ensure the safety and security of our users' assets.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Language of Risk -- some definitions</h2>
<p>In order to properly develop a risk analysis framework for the Web3 ecosystem, it's important to establish a common language of risk. Here are some key definitions that will be used throughout the framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk: the chance of loss in the context of crypto activities, measured in terms of the probability of an event occurring and the potential severity of the loss that could result from that event</li>
<li>Hazard: a condition specific to the crypto ecosystem that creates or increases the likelihood of a loss occurring. Hazards can be related to technology, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, or market-related, such as sudden price swings.</li>
<li>Loss: the reduction in value or benefits that results from a crypto-related event that causes harm or damage. Losses can be direct, such as the loss of crypto assets, or indirect, such as the loss of income or reputation.</li>
<li>Peril: the specific crypto-related event that causes a loss. Examples of perils in the crypto context include hacks, exploits, and scams.</li>
<li>Exposure: the potential for loss that an individual or organization faces due to their activities or circumstances in the crypto ecosystem. Exposure can be measured in terms of the likelihood of a loss occurring and the potential severity of that loss.</li>
<li>Risk Management: the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks specific to crypto activities to minimize the potential for loss. Risk management can include risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk transfer, and risk retention strategies.</li>
<li>Risk Assessment: the process of evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of different crypto-related risks. Risk assessment can involve quantitative analysis, such as probability and severity calculations, as well as qualitative analysis, such as expert opinion and judgment.</li>
<li>Risk Mitigation: the process of reducing the potential impact of a crypto-related loss by implementing risk control measures or transferring the risk to another party. Risk mitigation can include strategies such as insurance, contingency planning, and diversification.</li>
</ul>
<p>By developing a shared language of risk and a comprehensive risk analysis framework, we can create a more resilient and secure Web3 ecosystem for everyone</p>
<h2>Crypto Needs Insurance People</h2>
<p>f you've made it this far, you're likely on board with the idea that the Web3 ecosystem could benefit from a more sophisticated approach to risk analysis and mitigation. But how can we make this happen? One potential solution is to bring in the expertise of insurance professionals.</p>
<p>Insurance plays a crucial role in traditional finance by providing a safety net against the risks of loss or damage. However, the insurance industry has been slow to adopt Web3 technology, and there are few insurance options available to participants in the Web3 ecosystem. This is likely due in part to the fact that the risks associated with Web3 technology are still relatively new and not well-understood by traditional insurance companies.</p>
<p>But this lack of insurance options creates a gap in the risk management strategies available to Web3 participants. Without the ability to transfer risk to a third party, participants are left to manage the risks of their investments on their own. This can lead to a situation where participants are taking on more risk than they might otherwise, which could be a barrier to wider adoption.</p>
<p>Insurance professionals bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table, including expertise in risk assessment, risk management, and risk mitigation. By working together with Web3 developers and participants, insurance professionals could help to create a more resilient and secure Web3 ecosystem that is better equipped to handle the risks and challenges of this new technology.</p>
<p>In order to make this a reality, we need to start a conversation between the Web3 and insurance communities. This will require bridging the gap between these two worlds, and finding common ground on issues related to risk analysis and mitigation. It may also require the development of new insurance products that are specifically tailored to the risks and opportunities of Web3 technology.</p>
<p>By bringing together the worlds of insurance and Web3, we can create a more robust and resilient financial system that is better able to meet the needs of participants in the Web3 ecosystem. This is an exciting opportunity for both insurance professionals and Web3 developers alike, and we should be working together to make it a reality.</p>
<h2>Risk Management -- A Contrived Example</h2>
<h3>Risk Assessment for Compound</h3>
<p>To better illustrate how risk management can be applied to crypto, let's consider a lending protocol like Compound. As with any financial product, there are inherent risks associated with lending protocols, such as credit risk, market risk, operational risk, and legal and regulatory risk.</p>
<p>Credit risk refers to the risk that borrowers will default on their loans, leading to a loss for the lending protocol. For Compound, this risk could arise if borrowers are unable to repay their loans due to changes in the market or other unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Market risk refers to the risk that changes in the market will result in losses for the lending protocol. In the case of Compound, this could occur if the value of the collateral used by borrowers to secure their loans falls below a certain threshold, resulting in losses for the protocol.</p>
<p>Operational risk refers to the risk of loss due to errors or other operational issues. For Compound, this risk might arise if there are bugs or vulnerabilities in the smart contract code that could be exploited by attackers or if there are issues with the oracle that reports on the value of collateral used by borrowers.</p>
<p>Legal and regulatory risk refers to the risk of loss due to changes in laws or regulations. In the case of Compound, this risk might arise if there are changes in regulations that affect the operation of the lending protocol, such as changes in the treatment of crypto assets or restrictions on the use of smart contracts.</p>
<p>Once the potential risks have been identified, the next step is to assess the likelihood and potential impact of each risk. This might involve quantitative analysis, such as calculating the probability of default or estimating the potential losses associated with a market downturn. Quantitative analysis firms such as Gauntlet play a crucial role in this process, providing risk modeling and stress testing services to help protocols understand and manage their risks.</p>
<h3>Managing that Risk</h3>
<p>Now that the potential risks associated with the lending protocol have been identified and their likelihood and potential impact assessed, the next step is to develop a risk mitigation strategy. This involves implementing risk control measures such as collateral requirements, margin calls, diversification, and bug bounty programs to minimize the potential impact of credit, market, operational, and legal and regulatory risks.</p>
<p>For instance, to mitigate credit risk, Compound might require borrowers to maintain a certain amount of collateral relative to the size of their loan, ensuring that they have sufficient collateral to cover their loans. Additionally, the protocol might implement a liquidation mechanism to minimize the risk of loss due to default. To mitigate market risk, margin calls might be implemented to automatically trigger if the value of a borrower's collateral falls below a certain threshold, allowing the protocol to take action to prevent losses due to market volatility. Moreover, diversifying the collateral pool might help to reduce the risk of losses due to fluctuations in the value of any one asset.</p>
<p>In terms of mitigating operational risk, Compound might employ rigorous testing and auditing procedures to ensure that the smart contract code is secure and free from vulnerabilities. The protocol might also implement a bug bounty program to incentivize researchers to identify and report any bugs or vulnerabilities that are discovered. Additionally, the protocol might implement a circuit breaker mechanism that can be activated to halt the lending protocol in the event of an operational issue or security breach.</p>
<p>Finally, to mitigate legal and regulatory risk, Compound might work closely with legal experts to ensure that the protocol is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. The protocol might also implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to minimize the risk of legal and regulatory issues. Additionally, the protocol might consider obtaining insurance to cover any losses that may arise due to changes in laws or regulations. While these measures are essential to reduce the likelihood and potential impact of various risks, quantifying the likelihood of an adverse event can make it theoretically possible to insure against it.</p>
<h2>Insurance for our hypothetical lending protocol</h2>
<p>Insurance is a crucial component of risk management in traditional finance, and it could play a similarly important role in the Web3 ecosystem. Custom insurance products could be created specifically for lending protocols like Compound, covering potential risks such as credit risk or market risk. The cost of insurance premiums would depend on the level of risk and the amount of coverage required.</p>
<p>Working with insurance providers, Compound could determine the amount of coverage it needs based on the potential losses it could face and the cost of the premiums. Insurance providers could also provide risk assessment and management services to help Compound identify and mitigate potential risks.</p>
<p>Transferring risk to an insurance provider would enable Compound to reduce its exposure to losses and ensure that it is able to continue operating even in the event of a major loss. Alternatively, Compound could choose to retain the risk and build up a reserve fund to cover potential losses. By setting aside a portion of its profits to create a reserve fund, Compound could ensure that it is able to withstand any losses that may occur without having to rely on insurance or other risk mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Overall, the availability of insurance products tailored to the unique risks of Web3 technology could provide an important safety net for participants in the ecosystem. By working with insurance professionals to develop sophisticated risk management strategies, Web3 developers and participants can help to create a more resilient and secure Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Self-Insurance Is already the future</h2>
<p>The ever-evolving technology landscape has brought new risks that are not always covered by traditional insurance policies. As a result, technology companies have been forced to look for alternative ways to manage their risk exposure, one of which is self-insurance.</p>
<p>Self-insurance involves companies identifying the risks associated with their business, estimating the potential impact of those risks, and retaining the risk within the company itself. By doing so, the company is effectively self-insuring and can use its own resources to cover any losses that may arise due to identified risks.</p>
<p>This approach provides companies with a more customized and proactive approach to risk management, allowing them to better handle the risks associated with their business. The same principles can be applied to the crypto-finance sector by identifying unique risks associated with crypto-finance businesses, such as credit or market risk, and developing customized risk management strategies.</p>
<p>As technology continues to advance, self-insurance is becoming more common in various industries and is likely to become an increasingly important part of the risk management strategies used by crypto-finance businesses in the Web3 ecosystem. By self-insuring, these businesses can build a more resilient and secure financial system.</p>
<h2>A Discussion of Protocol Growth (A Digression)</h2>
<h3>How It Is Now</h3>
<p>The growth of the crypto industry has introduced a new approach to building and launching protocols, often characterized by a quick progression from ideation to mainnet launch, followed by the issuance of a protocol token to fund further development. This strategy is driven by a focus on Total Value Locked (TVL) as a key metric for success, with some projects quickly amassing billions of dollars in TVL. However, this rapid growth can come at the cost of other critical considerations such as security, scalability, and usability, which are essential for building sustainable and secure protocols that can benefit users in the long-term.</p>
<p>The current structure of protocol growth may incentivize short-term, liquidity-focused thinking, rather than a more strategic and cautious approach. Rapid growth can be risky, as protocols may be vulnerable to hacks or exploits due to inadequate testing or auditing, and the hype surrounding new projects can attract fraudulent or scam projects, leading to significant losses for investors and stakeholders.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, it's important for protocol builders and investors to prioritize building sustainable and secure protocols over chasing TVL. This requires taking a more strategic and cautious approach to protocol growth, focusing on thorough testing and auditing, prioritizing security, scalability, and usability, and engaging in responsible token issuance practices. By doing so, the Web3 ecosystem can build a more resilient and secure financial system that can withstand the challenges of this new technology.</p>
<h3>How it Should Be</h3>
<h4>Centralized Startup</h4>
<p>In the early stages of a protocol's development, having a small group of key stakeholders driving the development and direction of the protocol can be beneficial. This centralization can help ensure that the protocol is developed in a focused and efficient manner, with clear goals and objectives. However, it's important to recognize that centralization also comes with risks. Missteps or mistakes by the key stakeholders can have significant implications for the protocol as a whole.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, it's essential for centralization to be balanced with transparency and accountability. Key stakeholders must be held to high standards of performance and governance. This can be achieved through regular reporting and updates to the community, public audits, and clear communication channels. Having clear guidelines and protocols for decision-making and conflict resolution can also help ensure that the protocol's development stays on track.</p>
<h4>"Progressive Decentralization" (aka Growth)</h4>
<p>As a protocol gains traction and moves towards growth, it's important to adopt mechanisms that enable decentralized operation. The process of moving towards decentralization is known as "progressive decentralization". The goal of progressive decentralization is to put various parts of the protocol in the hands of trusted, but disparate individuals, and establish checks and balances that prevent any individual or group from taking control of the system.</p>
<p>To achieve this, a protocol must implement several key mechanisms such as permissionless operation, redundancy, censorship resistance, and self-sovereignty. Permissionless operation allows anyone to access and use the protocol without requiring approval or permission from any central authority. Redundancy involves eliminating single points of failure in the system to ensure that if one part of the protocol fails, the rest of the system can continue to operate. Censorship resistance ensures that the protocol is resistant to attempts to censor or control the flow of information or transactions. Finally, self-sovereignty ensures that users have complete control over their assets and can move them as they see fit, without any central authority controlling them.</p>
<p>By implementing these mechanisms, a protocol can become more resilient and secure, and can better withstand the challenges of the crypto ecosystem. This facilitates safe growth and creates a more sustainable and decentralized ecosystem for users.</p>
<h4>Decentralizing Ownership - The ICO</h4>
<p>As a protocol grows and gains traction, the ownership of the protocol can be transferred from the few to the many. This can be accomplished through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which allows users to purchase tokens that represent ownership in the protocol.</p>
<p>The ICO can be a powerful tool for decentralized governance, giving users a direct say in the direction and development of the protocol. Token holders can participate in voting on key decisions, such as changes to the protocol's governance structure, or the allocation of funds for development.</p>
<p>However, there are also many issues associated with token governance. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for market manipulation by whales or large token holders, who may have a disproportionate influence on the protocol's direction. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty around ICOs can make it difficult for protocols to raise funds through token offerings.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, it's important for protocols to have a clear and transparent governance structure in place, with well-defined voting procedures and mechanisms for addressing conflicts of interest. Protocols should also work closely with regulators to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and to minimize the potential for regulatory backlash.</p>
<h2>Insuring Your Protocol's Legacy</h2>
<p>Throughout the article, we have explored the unique risks and challenges that each phase of growth presents for a protocol. To manage these risks, it is crucial to adopt strategies such as insurance, whether through traditional insurance providers or self-insurance mechanisms.</p>
<p>Despite the limited number of insurers currently offering coverage for crypto protocols, protocols can still self-insure to protect themselves and their users. For instance, during the centralized phase of a protocol's development, it may be appropriate to fully insure the protocol's Total Value Locked (TVL) against risks such as hacks, exploits, or other types of losses.</p>
<p>In the decentralized phase of a protocol's development, the collateral ratio can be utilized as a metric for assessing insolvency risk, similar to how traditional financial institutions are evaluated. By providing users with transparent and comprehensive risk indicators, protocols can empower them to make informed decisions regarding their participation in the protocol.</p>
<p>While investment in crypto protocols will always carry some level of risk, by adopting a proactive and strategic approach to risk management and insurance, we can minimize these risks and ensure that the crypto ecosystem grows sustainably and positively. Even though some investors may still take risks, having risk indicators will at least enable them to make informed decisions.</p>
<h2>The Biggest Nayms in Crypto Insurance</h2>
<p>The growth of the crypto industry has led to the development of new financial infrastructure, including insurance products. Today, several tokenized insurance underwriting protocols exist at various stages of growth. The basic building blocks of these protocols include premiums, underwriting, claims processing, investment income, and token economics.</p>
<p>The primary source of revenue for a tokenized crypto insurance protocol is through the collection of premiums from users seeking to insure their assets. These premiums are priced according to the level of risk associated with insuring the asset, with higher risk assets commanding higher premiums. To accurately price premiums, the protocol must perform underwriting, which involves evaluating the risk associated with the asset being insured. This could be done through a combination of technical analysis, statistical modeling, and other risk assessment methods.</p>
<p>In the event that a user experiences a loss that is covered by the insurance policy, the protocol must process the claim and pay out the appropriate amount to the user. The speed and efficiency of claims processing is a key factor in attracting and retaining users.</p>
<p>The premiums collected by the protocol can be invested in a variety of ways to generate additional income for the protocol. For example, the premiums could be used to purchase stablecoins or other low-risk assets that generate yield through interest or other forms of passive income.</p>
<p>In addition to premiums, the token economics of the insurance protocol could also play a role in incentivizing users to participate in the protocol. For example, token holders could be given voting rights on key protocol decisions, or they could receive a share of the investment income generated by the protocol.</p>
<h3>Prior Art</h3>
<p>There are several crypto insurance protocols that have emerged in recent years, each with its own unique approach and value proposition. Here are a few of the most prominent examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nexus Mutual - Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance protocol that allows users to pool their funds and insure against smart contract bugs, hacks, and other types of losses. Members of the mutual are able to vote on insurance claims, premiums, and other key aspects of the protocol.</li>
<li>Cover Protocol - Cover Protocol is a peer-to-peer insurance marketplace that allows users to purchase coverage against smart contract hacks, exchange hacks, and other types of losses. Cover Protocol uses a unique coverage pool system that allows users to contribute funds and earn premiums on the coverage they provide.</li>
<li>InsurAce - InsurAce is a decentralized insurance protocol that provides coverage for smart contracts, centralized exchanges, and other types of risks. The protocol uses a risk-based pricing model that allows it to accurately price premiums based on the level of risk associated with the asset being insured.</li>
<li>Etherisc - Etherisc is a decentralized insurance protocol that allows users to purchase coverage for a variety of risks, including flight delays, crop failure, and other types of losses. The protocol uses a risk-based pricing model that allows it to accurately price premiums based on the level of risk associated with the asset being insured.</li>
<li>Unslashed Finance - Unslashed Finance is a decentralized insurance protocol that provides coverage for smart contracts, NFTs, and other types of risks. The protocol uses a unique staking model that allows users to earn premiums by staking their tokens and participating in the governance of the protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, these protocols represent an exciting new frontier in the world of insurance, and are likely to play an increasingly important role in managing risk in the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Self-Insured Retention for Crypto Hack Exposure</h3>
<p>Self-insurance protocols in the crypto industry are decentralized insurance mechanisms that enable startups and DAOs to self-insure against different risks associated with their business. These protocols offer a way for projects to mitigate risks, reduce potential losses for their users, and build trust and reputation within the ecosystem. Additionally, self-insurance protocols can generate additional revenue for participating projects.</p>
<h3>Foundational Phase</h3>
<p>During the pre-production development stage of a crypto startup or DAO, the insurance protocol can be underwritten by the company's investors in exchange for future token grants.
This helps reduce risk for users depositing funds into the protocol during this phase.</p>
<h4>Growth Phase</h4>
<p>When the protocol company decentralizes ownership via an ICO, it can allocate a significant percentage of the ICO to the insurance pool.
These tokens would be the first to be sold to the general public, with the proceeds being kept as collateral in the pool.</p>
<h4>Yield Generation</h4>
<p>As long as the company's product is not hacked, the collateral generates yield and compounds, granting dividends on the yield to underwriters.
The company would forego a portion of their yield in order to incentivize further underwriting from third-party institutional investors.</p>
<h4>Risk Assessment</h4>
<p>The protocol would perform rigorous risk assessment and underwriting to ensure that premiums are priced appropriately and that claims are paid out fairly and efficiently.</p>
<h4>Claims Processing</h4>
<p>If a user experiences a loss that is covered by the insurance policy, the protocol would process the claim and pay out the appropriate amount to the user in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
<h4>Token Economics</h4>
<p>The insurance protocol's token economics would be designed to incentivize participation and investment from a diverse range of stakeholders.
For example, token holders could receive dividends on the yield generated by the collateral, as well as voting rights on key protocol decisions.</p>
<h4>Growth and Expansion</h4>
<p>As the protocol grows and expands, it can continue to attract new underwriters and investors, further diversifying and strengthening the insurance pool.
This, in turn, can help reduce risk and increase trust for users depositing funds into the protocol.</p>
<h3>Benefits to Users</h3>
